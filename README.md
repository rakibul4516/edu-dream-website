>>Here are the five features and functionalities of my education and training event website:

1.Firebase Authentication: I implement Firebase Authentication to ensure the security of user accounts. This feature allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles securely, giving them access to personalized event information and resources.

2.Explore Events and Schedule: My website offers a user-friendly interface for exploring upcoming events and accessing event schedules. Users can easily browse, search, and filter events to find the ones that match their interests and availability.

3.Firebase Private Route Setup: To protect sensitive information and resources, I utilize Firebase to set up private routes. This means that certain sections or content of the website can only be accessed by authorized users, ensuring privacy and exclusivity for  event participants.

4.About Our Service: I provide a dedicated section to inform visitors about the services, schedule and mission of your education and training event. This feature helps to convey the unique value and expertise your event offers, encouraging potential participants to engage.
